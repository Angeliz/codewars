// Your goal in this kata is to implement an difference function, which subtracts one list from another.

// It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

// array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
// If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

// array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
function array_diff(a, b) {

    var arr = new Array();
    
    for(var i = 0;i<a.length;i++){
        if(b.indexOf(a[i])<0){
            arr.push(a[i]);
        }
    }
  
    return arr;
